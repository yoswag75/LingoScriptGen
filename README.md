## LingoScriptGen
LingoScriptGen is an innovative project aimed at streamlining the content creation process for creators who wish to adapt their content across different languages and cultures. Leveraging Recurrent Adversarial Networks (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLM), this project automates the creation of scripts and screenplays by taking input content in one language and generating culturally relevant scripts in another language. The model incorporates cultural references, memes, and movie tropes to ensure authenticity and engagement with the target audience. This hackathon idea targets content creators who face challenges in adapting their content for diverse linguistic and cultural audiences, providing them with a time-saving solution
